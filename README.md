# Far-Cry-3

1. This was a project to make a static website. HTML and CSS technologies were only used. No scaling was added for monitors beyond 1366x768 resolution, pages may look crumpled when watching from higher resolutions.

2. The website can be opened from here: https://stefanradic.github.io/Far-Cry-3/
